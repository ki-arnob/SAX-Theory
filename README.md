# SAX-Theory
SAX Theory (LCMâ€“GCD): A novel framework of relational computation in the unconscious mind.  Applies to psychology, decision-making, AI ethics, and paradox resolution.  Integrates expansionâ€“compression cycles for cognitive modeling.
# SAX Theory: Relational Computation of the Unconscious Mind

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
SAX Theory (LCM + GCD Cycle) is a novel theoretical framework developed by **Khaled Imran (2025)**.  
It proposes that the **unconscious mind operates through a relational computation mechanism**, structured around a cycle of **expansion (LCM)** and **compression (GCD)**.  

This model aims to explain how humans process hidden patterns, resolve paradoxes, and engage in decision-making beyond conscious awareness.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Core Idea
- **LCM Expansion:** The unconscious expands multiple relational inputs into possible harmonized outcomes.  
- **GCD Compression:** From diverse options, the unconscious compresses them into a minimal, common decision pathway.  
- **Relational Feedback Loop:** Expansion and compression repeat continuously, shaping unconscious choices, intuition, and implicit cognition.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions
- **Psychology:** Offers a new way to understand unconscious decision-making & implicit cognition.  
- **AI Research:** Provides inspiration for relational algorithms in machine learning and humanâ€“AI ethics.  
- **Philosophy:** Introduces a computational lens to interpret paradoxes and human reasoning patterns.  
- **Cognitive Science:** Bridges mathematical structures with mental processes.
