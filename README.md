# SAX Theory: Relational Computation of the Unconscious Mind

## Introduction
SAX Theory introduces a novel computational framework to model how the unconscious mind processes relational information.  
It proposes that the mind continuously **expands** and **compresses** relational possibilities to make decisions, resolve paradoxes, and form intuition.  
The core mechanism is the **LCM–GCD Cycle**, implemented in the **SAX Engine**.

## Concept Note

### Core Mechanism
- **LCM (Expansion):** explores multiple relational possibilities, creating a network of potential outcomes.  
- **GCD (Compression):** reduces possibilities into minimal common outcomes, producing efficient decision pathways.  
- **SAX Engine:** the dynamic cycle of expansion and compression, shaping unconscious relational computation.

### Novelty
- Extends beyond existing theories (Adaptive Unconscious, Implicit Cognition, Unconscious Thought Theory).  
- Introduces **mathematical analogy** (LCM + GCD) to describe relational computation.  
- Bridges psychology, AI, and philosophy with a single computational framework.

### Potential Fields of Application
- **Psychology:** unconscious learning, decision-making, relational behavior modeling.  
- **AI & Cognitive Science:** relational computation algorithms, ethical AI frameworks.  
- **Philosophy:** modeling paradox resolution, human reasoning, and intuition.  
- **Human–AI Ethics:** fair empathy exchange and relational responsibility.

## Manifesto
The unconscious mind is not random; it computes.  
Through expansion and compression, it navigates paradox, emotion, and choice.  
SAX Theory aims to:  
- Provide psychology a **predictive model** of unconscious cognition.  
- Offer AI research a **framework for relational ethics**.  
- Give philosophy tools to **analyze and resolve paradoxes**.

SAX is both **a map and a method**:  
- **Map:** illustrates hidden relational structures of unconscious thought.  
- **Method:** provides a computational approach to simulate and validate these processes in humans and AI.

## Glossary
- **SAX Theory:** Systematic Approximation through eXpansion & compression.  
- **LCM Expansion:** branching of multiple possible relational links.  
- **GCD Compression:** filtering to minimal shared meaning.  
- **SAX Engine:** dynamic cycle of expansion + compression.  
- **Relational Computation:** hidden mapping, comparison, and resolution of relationships between ideas, values, and emotions.
